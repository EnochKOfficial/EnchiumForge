# Enchium Forge 🧪

**Enchium Forge** is a professional-grade, interactive 3D molecular visualization platform powered by **JSmol** for exploring complex chemical compounds, proteins, and biological structures.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Real-time Atomic Search**: Instantly materialize 3D models from the **NIH PubChem** database using a smart autocomplete engine.
* **Dynamic Labeling System**: Toggle element symbols (C, H, O, N, etc.) directly on the 3D canvas for precise structural analysis.
* **Biological Cycling**: Switch between curated proteins and DNA structures (PDB models) to observe secondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets.
* **Interactive Rendering**: Toggle between Ball-and-Stick, Spacefill (Van der Waals), and Cartoon visualization presets.
* **Scientific Console**: Execute custom Jmol scripts for advanced tasks like vibration analysis, distance measurements, and zoom scaling.



## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Core Engine**: [JSmol (HTML5)](https://jmol.sourceforge.net/) — The open-source standard for chemical structures in 3D.
* **Data API**: NIH PubChem and RCSB PDB databases.
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom palette derived from the **Enchium** element logo.
* **Icons**: Lucide-React for a modern UI interface.
